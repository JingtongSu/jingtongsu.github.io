== About me
Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at NYU [https://cds.nyu.edu/ Center for Data Science], working with Professor [https://cims.nyu.edu/~kempe/ Julia Kempe]. My research interests are around machine learning, both in designing algorithms based on theoretical insights and empirical observation, and in its applications to sciences such as physics. I spent a wonderful summer together with Prof. [https://jasondlee88.github.io Jason D.~Lee] and a group of incredible teammates via the [https://international.princeton.edu/international-students-and-scholars/International-Student-Internship-Program Princeton ISIP program] online last summer. I did my undergraduate thesis together with Prof. [https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/ Yisen Wang] and a group of heartwarming seniors :D\n
